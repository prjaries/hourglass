# hourglass
A WIP scheduling server for CasparCG that allows for a fixed hourly time slot for certain programs.

# Requires:
- A CasparCG server
- ffmpeg in your system path or execution directory
- Video files to act as filler, content, and whatever you want to run in your fixed time slot


# TODO:
- config file
- fix scheduler bugs when starting program close to runtime of the time slot.
