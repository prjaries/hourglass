# hourglass
A WIP scheduling system for CasparCG that allows for a fixed hourly time slot for certain programming. This system is primarily built for the Project Aries IntelliSTAR source feeds that we provide to users, and acts as the primary testbed.

# Requires:
- A CasparCG server
- ffmpeg in your system path or execution directory
- Video files to act as filler, content, and whatever you want to run in your fixed time slot


# TODO:
- logging playback for future reference
